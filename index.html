<h1 id="the-harth-programming-language">The Harth Programming Language</h1>


<p>Last Update: February 29, 2016</p>


<h2 id="why-the-name-harth">Why The Name &ldquo;Harth&rdquo;?</h2>

<p>Harth is a contraction of <strong>Har</strong>vey <strong>Th</strong>ompson. That way people can
be sure who the original author was.</p>

<p>The name also evokes the idea of a &ldquo;Hearth&rdquo;, a warm and cosy often
industrial sized fire-place in the home or blacksmith&rsquo;s; here food is
cooked or new tools are forged.</p>

<p><img src="/img/hearth-blacksmith.jpg" alt="Hearth" style="width: 400px;"/></p>

<h2 id="yet-another-programming-language">Yet Another Programming Language?</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>The nice thing about standards is that there are so many of them to choose from.</p>

<p><em>Andrew S. Tanenbaum</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ve used many programming languages in my 30 years of
programming. Each of them have some good and not-so good parts. I&rsquo;ve
often wondered what would happen if you took all the reasonable bits
of each and made a programming language from that. [Harth] is that
experiment.</p>

<p>Hopefully [Harth] will not turn into a Jack-of-all-Trades (and master
of none), nor a confusing Swiss-Army-Knife programming language (the
sort you use if you can&rsquo;t find your professional toolbox).</p>

<p>See also Mike Taylor&rsquo;s: &ldquo;What is your [Favourite Programming Language]?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mine would probably be Emacs. Wait, Waaa? [Emacs] is actually a [Lisp] Programming Language runtime disguised as an extremely customizable editor.</p>

<p>Vi-Schmi. Visual Whatevers.</p>

<h2 id="programming-languages-i-borrowed-ideas-from">Programming Languages I Borrowed Ideas From</h2>

<p>In building [Harth] I&rsquo;m borrowing some of the &ldquo;good&rdquo; ideas from
various existing programming languages. Each of them are well worth
learning and using in their own right. I&rsquo;m also very aware and am
grateful for the massive amount of work put in by all the clever
people behind each of these programming languages.</p>

<p>Programming languages I&rsquo;ve actually used:</p>

<ul>
<li>[C]</li>
<li>[C++]</li>
<li>[C#]</li>
<li>[Java]</li>
<li>[Lisp]</li>
<li>[Python]</li>
</ul>

<p>Programming languages I&rsquo;ve not really used, but have read about
interesting ideas worth borrowing:</p>

<ul>
<li>[Ceylon]</li>
<li>[Erlang]</li>
<li>[Julia]</li>
<li>[Kotlin]</li>
<li>[Ruby]</li>
<li>[Rust]</li>
<li>[Swift]</li>

<h1 id="project-background-september-14-2015">Project Background (September 14 2015)</h1>

<p>The high level vision for the project is to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Help software engineers make great tools for themselves and other software engineers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Software Engineers (programmers) use many tools, the most important of
which is essentially a high tech type-writer; the code editor. This is
something like Word (or Notepad), and they write text (code) which is
saved in text files. There are many other tools which provide some
additional functions that help programmers. These features may already
exist in in the code editor, or may find found in a separate tool.</p>

<h2 id="other-programmer-tools">Other Programmer Tools</h2>

<p>Some of the tools or features a programmer needs are;</p>

<ul>
<li>Find Documentation - Less of the &ldquo;ARGH Help How do I? Sheesh, Where is the help?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Find Definition - The programmer can look up definitions of
particular piece of code, much like a dictionary or thesaurus.</li>
<li>Find References - The programmer can find all the references to a
particular piece of code, much like an index or table of contents.</li>
<li>Search/Replace &amp; Refactoring - The programmer can ask the computer
to make specific global changes to the code. For example:

<ul>
<li>Changing the name of something everywhere.</li>
<li>Moving some code to somewhere else.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Auto Complete - The programmer can type short cuts and expand them,
like auto-complete on phones.</li>
<li>Error Highlighting - The programmer can see errors in their code
almost immediately, like the red squiggly lines in Word that show
spelling mistakes.</li>
<li>Compilation - The programmer can compile the program into code, and
at this point will be told about more problems in what they have
written (like a human editor would for a book or news story).</li>
<li>Debugger - The programmer can run their program step by step and see
what’s going on (debugging); often this is needed because the
programmer has made a logical mistake that the computer cannot
possibly detect.</li>
<li>Syntax Highlighting - The text is styled and coloured to highlight
important information: much like headings in documents.</li>
<li>Interactive Session - The programmer can type additional pieces of
code and perhaps modify the code while it’s running, to help correct
problems (bugs) in their code.</li>
<li>Unit Tests - The programmer can write extra “test” code that checks
what they have written; this can be run automatically to catch
problems which are introduced as they change their program.</li>
<li>Quality Tests - The programmer can use some automated code to
evaluate code quality, for example;

<ul>
<li>How much of the code has tests.</li>
<li>How much of the code is documented for programmers.</li>
<li>How complex the code is.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Issue Tracking - The programmer can create “To-Do” lists of things
they need to do later; building software is like growing a city -
you start with a one house, but very quickly there’s 1001 buildings,
each with 1001 different problems to solve.</li>
<li>Change Management - The programmer can save versions of code, both
locally and on the web, and use this this to collaborate with others.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="woah-too-much">Woah, Too Much!</h2>

<p>There is an almost endless list of tools a programmer might
need. Consider Home Depot and how many hammers, drills, spanners,
screwdrivers, rulers, saws might be needed to build and maintain a
house. Likewise there are 1001 tools a programmer might need to use to
build good software. Not all the tools exist in one place, and not all
the tools are as good as they could be, or easily available, or cheap.</p>

<p>My aim is not to provide all 1001 tools. That task is far too big for
one person to achieve.</p>

<p>But we have to start somewhere.</p>

<h2 id="long-term-aims">Long Term Aims</h2>

<p>So a more realistic aim for this project is to:</p>

<p>Provide a great foundation for many programmers to write and share
good tools a little easier, as and when they need them.</p>

<p>Currently there has been an explosion in software developers creating
new programming languages out of the desire to solve the cohesive lack
of good tools. “Yet Another Programming Language” is announced, but
most software developers groan at each solution, but can’t quite
understand why. A few have discovered that we’re often repeating the
same patterns and even mistakes. We have to try to think a little
differently, dig for the hidden gems of ideas that a few smart people
have discovered, some of these could make a big difference.</p>

<h2 id="medium-term-aims">Medium Term Aims</h2>

<p>So the more focused aim of this project is to:</p>

<p>Try to collect the most modern and alternative ideas in one place, to
try something a little different.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Optionally talk about types as much as possible:

<ul>
<li>Mostly static, or inferred static, with a dash of dynamic if you wants it.</li>
<li>Types are inferred if you assign something that&rsquo;s of a known type.</li>
<li>Infer return type.</li>
<li>Infer generic types.</li>
<li>Closures types are inferred most of the time.</li>
<li>Infer argument types (that can be hard, but use generics?)</li>
<li>If you &ldquo;do not care yet&rdquo;, use <code>dynamic</code> which essentially says
&ldquo;call method/function dynamically with cache runtime checks, your
code may crash&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Dynamic is in [C#] and a few other Net based languages you know!</li>
<li>See Mike Taylor&rsquo;s [Static And Dynamic Typing]</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What if we didn’t write code as text saved to a text file?

<ul>
<li>Well that&rsquo;s not good for things like git, diff, emacs, vi and a billion other text processors!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What if code was stored in a database like system?

<ul>
<li>SQL and anything like that actually is too much.</li>
<li>What is the fundamental thing that they actually provide. Only have that thing.</li>
<li>Hint: Probably Guids (Globally unique IDs, that is keys) for names.</li>
<li>Hint: Possibly a way to link things in relationships (definition/use etc).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What if code was more like the internet, a data rich, textual,
graphical mixture?

<ul>
<li>HTML links in your code. What nonsense.</li>
<li>Autobuilt links like you get on some web based source databases.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What if the programming ecosystem itself fully understood itself?</li>
<li>This idea has been around since the 1960’s, but most languages only
go so far; providing access to understanding only the high level
constructs.</li>
<li>Provide full 100% understanding of all code as a library (Microsoft
are doing this with something called Roysln, which is part of their
next Visual Studio 2015 release).</li>
<li>Provide full 100% ability to convert text to executable code, and
debug as a library (Apple use something called LLVM which does this
at a lower level as part of their XCode development system).</li>
<li>What if the programming ecosystem ditched manual processes that just
make the human’s life harder and more miserable?</li>
<li>What if the programming ecosystem automated more processes so that
the human can concentrate on the creative side more?</li>
<li>What if the programming ecosystem helped the human as much as possible to read and write good code in the first place?</li>
<li>Code completion should eventually mean you actually type less.

<ul>
<li>Code completer could insert &ldquo;sensed&rdquo; meaning, eg. inferred types.</li>
<li>Code completer means this:</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>The fuzzy match 
  
  
    <span class="harth-key">dulbin</span>
  
    

 would also match <code>DoubleInt</code>
since its the only thing that uniquely contains those characters
in roughly the right order.</p></li>

<li><p>Ambiguities should provide a text-sensitive helper pop-up in
GUIs. Much like most decent editors.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Still this is a quite a lot of work, so we need a more realistic shorter term aims for this project.</p>

<h2 id="goals-for-2015">Goals For 2015</h2>

<p>The goal for the end of year 2015 is to:</p>

<p>Build a new prototype programming environment based on more new and
modern ideas learned from experience and academia.</p>

<p>These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Familiar programming language - a programming language that will be
fimiliar to most people; built on top of C++, but with ideas taken
from Java, C#, Swift, Erlang, Scala, Lisp, Smalltalk, &hellip;</li>
<li>Static type system - the programmer must be clear and explicit about
what the program is doing.</li>
<li>Use the static type system to solve more problems:

<ul>
<li>No null pointer exceptions - “The Billion Dollar Mistake” has
plagued us for too long, and most more modern languages are
solving this quite neatly.</li>
<li>Some people don&rsquo;t see this as a big deal. Sure:</li>
<li>If you check all your pointers in Java, C#, C++.</li>
<li>Or you use references (in C++) or stack values.</li>
<li>Or you remember to anotate them with @null and @notnull (or whatever).</li>
<li>Pointers, who needs &lsquo;em.</li>
<li>Optionality is useful for saying &ldquo;Zero or One of X&rdquo;.
Example &ldquo;<code>ParseInt(String) -&gt; Int?</code> either returns the integer or null meaning you lose).
Think of it as a soft-error return.</li>
<li>The static type system encodes the optionality in the type, and
you can&rsquo;t get round it without being explicit (ie. I &ldquo;assert&rdquo; it
cannot be null).</li>
<li>Programs always can crash :-(</li>
<li>See [Error 1] [Error 2].</li>
<li>Non-exceptional run-time error handling - the programmer must
explicitly and consciously handle the problems user’s might face
as close to the source as possible.</li>
<li>Exceptions were initially thought of as a good solution, but have proven to be a “bad” idea, though many people havn’t realized or agree on this yet.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Garbage collection - the programmer is absolved from worrying about
memory management, computers are much better at doing this labor
intensive task without error. This is contentious with some
programmers; the answer to that is you shouldn’t do this for low
level programming, but we’re not dealing in this area, so it’s good
and right to do so.</li>
<li>Concurrency - modern computers have multiple processors, to use
these effectively the programmer needs an easy way to use the CPUs
effectively.</li>
<li>Use task/actor systems that share only immutable data, no locking
and no mutation means the programmer can more easily understand how
to do this well and without bugs.</li>
<li>Self awareness - The programming language provides a library to
understand itself fully:

<ul>
<li>Convert text to an in-memory editable data structure.</li>
<li>Convert this in-memory structure back to text.</li>
<li>Analyze these data structures for full meaning, cross referencing,
and compile time (programmer) errors.</li>
<li>Provide layers on top for editors, scripting, compilation,
debugging and interactive features that are commonly needed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Prototype - showing some of the basic required features listed in
Background earlier, showing how easy such tools are to build given
the foundation:

<ul>
<li>Find Definition</li>
<li>Find Reference</li>
<li>Auto Complete</li>
<li>Error Highlighting</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Prototype stretch - show some cool and mandatory but important
features to prove it really can work:

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Google Maps” Code View - this is an “exciter” in that I’ve not
seen it done in many products, only hinted at in research.</li>
<li>Exporter</li>
<li>Compilation</li>
<li>Interactive Session</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="status">Status</h1>

<h1 id="on-september-14-2015">On September 14, 2015</h1>

<p>Rough completion for this years goal (not for a full final
implementation) from the above list:</p>

<ul>
<li>Familiar programming language - done</li>
<li>Static type system - done</li>
<li>No null pointer exceptions - done</li>
<li>Non-exception run-time error handling - done</li>
<li>Garbage collection - 80%</li>
<li>Concurrency - Deferred; this problem is complex to implement, not
required to progress, and has already been proven to work very well
on other projects.</li>
<li>Self-awareness - 50%</li>
<li>Prototype - 0%</li>
<li>Prototype stretch - 0%</li>
</ul>

<p>Some stats, which if you’re aware of programmer productivity is very
high. However I’ve been careful to work only about 8 hours for 6 days
of the week to avoid burn out.</p>

<ul>
<li>Lines of code written to date (from Jan 1st): 145,000</li>
<li>Average daily line count: 650</li>
<li>Number of code files: 25300</li>
<li>Total committed changes: 2670</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="on-october-27-2015">On October 27, 2015</h1>

<p>I’ve completed the Prototype goals already two months ahead of
schedule! :-D</p>
